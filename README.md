## npm registry access

Set an `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable with access to `https://registry.npmjs.org` before running `npm install` (for example via `.env`, CI secrets, or deployment settings). The `.npmrc` file reads this token automatically and forces `always-auth` so scoped packages such as `@hookform/resolvers` can be downloaded without 403 errors.
